# My Notes

## TDD

### What is It?

It is a software development technic that the idea is focus on the test scenarios and then the coding. 
This helps to focus on the result/output of the features and many others aspects.

There are 3 steps on the process:

1 - Define 1 or more scenarios that you will need to fulfill;
2 - Code in order to make the tests succeeded;
3 - Check if there are points to improve, if so, make a refactor and check if the tests keeping going well.

This loop of 3 steps should be executed as many times as necessary until the code be as good as possible.

### Why use TDD

- Make sure that the code is working as planned;
- Make easier the code maintenance;
- Help to understand what needs to be done, the core of the functionality;
- Encourage refactors.

## JUnit

- It is the standard unitary test library for Java;
- Pretty old, It was created in the 90s.
